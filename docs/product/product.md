### Development Metrics

- **Code Quality**: 85%+ test coverage, comprehensive type checking, automated formatting
- **Data Pipeline Health**: Automated monitoring and alerting for data collection processes
- **Performance**: Optimized queries with TimescaleDB, fast vector search with pgvectorscale
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture patterns, comprehensive documentation

## Technical Constraints

### Requirements

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB and pgvectorscale extensions
- **Python Environment**: Python 3.13+ with comprehensive dependency management
- **API Access**: OpenRouter API key for LLM access, optional FinnHub for real-time data
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose for local development, Dagster for data orchestration

### Architectural Decisions

- **Single Developer Focus**: Optimized for individual use rather than multi-user collaboration
- **PostgreSQL-First**: All data persistence through PostgreSQL with appropriate extensions
- **OpenRouter Exclusive**: Unified LLM provider reduces complexity and improves consistency
- **Domain Completion**: Sequential domain development (news 95% → marketdata → socialmedia)

## Project Scope

### Current Implementation Status

- **News Domain**: 95% complete with comprehensive article scraping and sentiment analysis
- **Core Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB + pgvectorscale foundation established
- **Agent Framework**: RAG-powered agents with vector search capabilities
